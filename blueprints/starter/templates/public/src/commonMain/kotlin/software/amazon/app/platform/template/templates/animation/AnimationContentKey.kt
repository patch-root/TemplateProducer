/**
 * The sample application supports animations between models and templates. [BaseModel] classes can
 * implement this interface to indicate when a change occurred that should be animated. [contentKey]
 * represents a unique value for an animation state. If the value doesn't change between new models,
 * then no animation will be started.
 *
 * An example may look like this:
 * ```
 * data class Model(
 *     val showPictureFullscreen: Boolean,
 *     ...
 * ) : BaseModel, AnimationContentKey {
 *     override val contentKey: Int =
 *         if (showPictureFullscreen) 1 else AnimationContentKey.DEFAULT_CONTENT_KEY
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In this sample when `showPictureFullscreen` changes from `true` to `false` and vice versa then an
 * animation will be started using [AnimatedContent]. Use [LocalAnimatedVisibilityScope] and
 * [LocalSharedTransitionScope] to get access to the right scopes.
